# 📦 Inventory Management App (Android – Java)

This is my **Inventory Management System App**, built entirely using **Android Java**.

Fun fact:  
This project was *originally supposed to be a simple Java console program* for college 😄  
…but I decided to convert it into a complete **Android app** with proper UI, categories, product management, and stock handling.

It’s a big upgrade from my earlier Tic-Tac-Toe app and helped me improve both UI design and app structuring.
